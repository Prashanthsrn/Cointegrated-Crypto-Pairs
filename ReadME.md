# 📊 Cointegrated Crypto Pairs Statistical Arbitrage

## Overview

This project implements a **Statistical Arbitrage (StatArb) strategy** on cryptocurrency pairs using **cointegration and mean reversion principles**.  

Instead of predicting price direction, the strategy exploits **temporary deviations from long-term equilibrium** between two cointegrated assets.  

- **Goal:** Identify profitable pairs of cryptocurrencies whose prices move together, and trade when their spread deviates from the equilibrium.  
- **Assets analyzed:** BTC, ETH, MATIC, AVAX, etc.  
- **Timeframe:** Rolling windows of historical data (daily frequency).

## 📈 Problem Statement

Many crypto pairs have a **stable long-term relationship** (e.g., BTC–ETH). Short-term deviations in their relative price can be exploited:

1. **Identify cointegrated pairs**: pairs whose spread is stationary over time.  
2. **Measure deviation**: calculate z-score of spread.  
3. **Trade mean reversion**: go long the laggard, short the leader when spread exceeds thresholds.  

> This strategy is **market-neutral**, focusing on **spread reversion** rather than absolute price movement.

## 🧠 Quantitative Approach

### 1. Cointegration
We model the relationship as:

\[
Y_t = \alpha + \beta X_t + \epsilon_t
\]

- \(Y_t, X_t\) = prices of the pair  
- \(\epsilon_t\) = residual (spread)  
- Test if \(\epsilon_t\) is **stationary** using **ADF test**.  
- Cointegration implies spread will **mean-revert**.

### 2. Spread and Z-score
\[
\text{spread}_t = Y_t - (\alpha + \beta X_t)
\]

\[
z_t = \frac{\text{spread}_t - \mu}{\sigma}
\]

- \(\mu, \sigma\) = mean and std of spread in the rolling window  
- Trading signals are generated when \( |z_t| > 1.0 \) (entry) and \( |z_t| < 0.1 \) (exit).

### 3. Trading Rules
| Z-score | Position |
| -------- | -------- |
| z > +1  | Short spread (short Y, long X) |
| z < -1  | Long spread (long Y, short X) |
| z ≈ 0   | Exit position |

### 4. Risk Metrics
- **Total PnL** = cumulative profit/loss  
- **Sharpe Ratio** = risk-adjusted return  
- **Max Drawdown** = largest peak-to-trough loss
